# [Depreceated!] - Reddit no longer allows sports streaming subreddits.
# Streamliner for Reddit
Streamliner for Reddit is a chrome extension designed to skip the hastle of going through comments on streaming subreddits

When a reddit user opens a game-day thread in any of 13 supported sports streaming subreddits (i.e. r/soccerstreams, r/nhlstreams, etc...).

The moment the user clicks, streamliner will automatically go through the comments of the thread to find the best link to a stream and open a new tab directed the stream.
